### Metadata 
**Use case**

Metadata called “Document Approval” could be created which lists fields such as file type, the originator of the file, who approved it, and when it was approved.

You could then move all files that have been approved into one folder and apply the metadata to the folder. All the files in the folder will be identified as approved. You can edit metadata for the different files to show their approval date, who approved it, and any other pertinent details.
